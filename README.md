Write a program that predicts house prices based on the provided dataset(variant1). Use at least two differentmethods (e.g. Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, SVM, ...) and compere their performance. You should also deliver report that includes the comparison of metrics for each used method and explanation of which method consider thebest. The solutions you deliver will be evaluated based on the results of the chosen models and the correctness of your research methods. 

1)Properly divide, investigate, and preprocess the data.
2)Correctly implement the regression and classification algorithms.
3)Correctly implement the regression and classification algorithms.
4)Implement validation and testing and perform research on their results.
